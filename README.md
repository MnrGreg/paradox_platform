# paradox_platform
Paradox alarm homebridge platform

This is my initial release of a paradox platform.  I have tested on my Paradox MG5050 v4.

The code is based on Tertiush Python scripts, as well as several sample homebridge accessories/platforms I could find.

My initial attempt used Python script based on Tertiush code and works well.  I ported the scripts to Node for this release and still needs some work.
